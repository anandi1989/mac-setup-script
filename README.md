**Primary Installation Steps**

*Xcode tools*: 
`xcode-select â€”install`

*Homebrew*: 

[HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) is an Open-Source software pakage manager. It is Very handy and essential for mac terminal to install\uninstall open source softwares 

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

basic command for installing softwares via homebrew package manager:

*CASK*:

[CASK](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) `brew cask` is an extension of `brew` install GUI based application. 

Basic steps for CASK usages - 
* `brew install cask`

*Other Utilities*

If you are a [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) user, you must have used `htop` for inspecting CPU usages. Well you can use the same in Mac as well.

to install `htop` - `brew install htop`
`run` by `sudo htop` as this application will need to access hardware info from the kernals 


Another must have utility is `SPEEDTEST`. I use it all the time via browser. But `CLI` application is much cooler. 
to install `speedtest` - `brew install speedtest-cli`
`run` by `speedtest-cli`
