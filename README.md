**Primary Installation Steps**

*Xcode tools*: 
`xcode-select â€”install`

[HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) is an Open-Source software pakage manager. It is Very handy and essential for mac terminal to install\uninstall open source softwares 

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

basic command for installing softwares via homebrew package manager: 

* `brew install [package_name]`

*CASK*:

[CASK](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) `brew cask` is an extension of `brew` install GUI based application. 

Basic steps for CASK usages - 
* `brew install cask`
* `brew search --casks` this for searching apps under cask`
* `brew search [package_name]`
* `brew cask update` for updating packages
* `brew cask help` for checking advance option for cask

*PYTHON*

`pyenv` is a Open-Source Package Manager for python version control in a single system. Setting up python using `pyenv` in very easy and effective. This will not imapct system python version. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on GitHub.
Basic installation steps are - 

*`brew install pyenv` 
* `pyenv` should print current version `1.2.20` *(as of today)*
* `pyenv install --list` or `pyenv install -list | grep -ow 3.8.5` just to check if latest version of python [release](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) is available with `pyenv`
* `pyenv install [version_name]` e.g. `3.8.5`
* Finally check available version(s) with `pyenv` by `pyenv versions`

To know more about `pyenv` please refer [here](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#using-pyenv-to-install-python)

Next step after installing python with `pyenv` is to install another popular package manager `pipenv`. It is a package manager for handling python libraries 

Basic installation can be done by - 
* `brew install pipenv`
* `pipenv -version` should return latest version `2020.8.13`. This should also install lastest `python3` to mac by default and `pip3`

To know more please refer [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

*Adding `pyenv` into the `$PATH`*

```
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc[.bash_profile]
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc[.bash_profile]
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc[.bash_profile]

```

*Other Utilities*

If you are a [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) user, you must have used `htop` for inspecting CPU usages. Well you can use the same in Mac as well.

to install `htop` - `brew install htop`
`run` by `sudo htop` as this application will need to access hardware info from the kernals 


Another must have utility is `SPEEDTEST`. I use it all the time via browser. But `CLI` application is much cooler. 
to install `speedtest` - `brew install speedtest-cli`
`run` by `speedtest-cli`


Software Updates checking via commandline - 
`softwareupdate`
